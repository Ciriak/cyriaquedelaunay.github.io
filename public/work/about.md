## Hi ! I'm Cyriaque ðŸ‘‹

I have been actively working in web development since the early 2010's

Nowaday i mainly work with **React**, **Typescript**, and all the ecosystem around it.

I've had my years of PHP and legacy stuff but i don't really want to deal with that anymore, at least not as my main tech.

Since a few years, a decided to specialized myself into Front-end development, wich is basically the "visual" part of development.

<small>"Small" list of tools i use :) : </small>

I believe the only way to actually learn new things is to practice, screw the theory, you are not in school anymore, this is an industry were things move fast , **really** fast.

Copy example code, play with it, understand how it work.

**Work on side projects**

Also accept the fact that there will be a 18 Yo kid that will teach you your own job in a few years... probably.

## Design

As a front-end developer, i work a lot with visual stuff : integrating mockups, making websites responsive, exchanging with the UI and UX designers.

Even if it's not my main job, i really like designing logos and mockups for my projects :

<small>For now, all my side projects have been designed by myself</small>

## Audio production

I am quietly doing some music production for fun during my free time, it's mainly experiments since i work on music the same way i work for development : trial and error

I am using **FL Studio** and a **Komplete Kontrol S61** keyboard

The only "real" project related to music i have for now is my [alternate soundtrack for Factorio](/work/remote-and-unexplored), i also did some prototypes for my [ld49 entry](/work/ld49) that was canceled
