One major problem when you play on PC is that every game editor want it's own launcher.

Uplay, Origins, Epic Game Launcher, Battle.net... for real, it's a mess.

The other problem i have is that i am a huge Valve Fanboy and a vast majority of my game library is on STeam, wich , you guessed it, is yet another launcher (but a better one tbh)

On steam, you have a way to add external games to your library, but it's a very "manual" and boring task.

As a lazy person , i immediately thought "hey, why not spending weeks trying to automate this 15 sec process ?"

And so i did :

Steam Scanner look for all supported launchers installed, try to find the games associated and add them to your Steam library.

The neat part is that it also download the games cover using <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com">Steam Grid</a>
