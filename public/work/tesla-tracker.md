## A collection of tools for tracking and datamining Tesla services

<img src="/images/tesla-tracker/tesla-tracker-icon.png"  height="128px">

Basically this is a group of bots that look around the various Tesla platforms (website, API, images set) and log all changes at various intervals

I plan to use theses tools to find when new car paint will be available, new Superchargers address or heck, even new car models who knows :o)
