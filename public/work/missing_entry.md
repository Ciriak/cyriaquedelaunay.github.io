A "textual" / "you are the hero" game created for the 45th [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/missing-entry)

### Won the 4th place for innovation ðŸ¥³

The theme was "start with nothing"

I wanted to focus mainly on tech i already knew and i was a bit into RPG at the time.

It used a client/ server infrastructure, each entry added by a player was made availabler to everyone.

Sadly this project is years old so i don't have a live version online anymore
