A game project intended for the 49th edition of the [Ludum Dare game jam](https://ldjam.com/).

The idea was to make a game in 72h

The project was sadly canceled (see below)

## The idea

The theme of this edition was **Unstable**

The idea was to make a roguelike game inspired by the binding of isaac

The player would have to clear a succession of rooms to progress

After clearing a room, the player would have been granted a random item with a bonus AND a malus wich manifest randomly (**unstable** items)

Between each room a dialogue between the 2 characters would have been played
